      <p> GROUP PROJECT WEB SITE <br>
        Each group will be required to establish a website for portraying information on their project. <br>
        The project web site need not be sophisticated. However, it should promote your “corporate” image and product to its intended customers, including: <br>
         home page with project name, group members & their tasks, supervisor, assessor and date last modified. <br>
         product description page(s) <br>
         documentation page (including user manual and technical manual links) <br>
         a presentation of the project (video/audio/PPT) <br>
         contact us‟ page, FAQ page, etc. <br>
        The MPEG video should basically provide a demonstration of your product and its functionality. <br>
        It is common practice to integrate a PowerPoint Presentation into the video. Such video‟s can be generated using freeware <br>
